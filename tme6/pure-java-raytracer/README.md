# pure-java-raytracer
An experimental Ray tracer I made completely from scratch, without any external libraries.  
This program was made for testing/learning purposes only, which is why it runs mostly single-threaded on the CPU.  
I covered the development of this engine in [this video on my YouTube channel.

## Features:
 - Diffuse lighting
 - Specular lighting
 - Ray-traced shadows
 - Ray-traced recursive reflections
 - HDRI Skybox rendering
 - Bloom post-processing effect
 - Image rendering (any resolution)
 - Animated image sequence rendering (any resolution, any framerate)

Rendered images will be saved as `output.png` in the execution directory of the program and image sequences will be saved inside the `image_sequence` folder in the execution directory.
